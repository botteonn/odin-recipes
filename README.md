# odin-recipes

This project is done using The Odin Project as the main resource.

### Recipes Website
This will be a simple web page, created for testing the learning path of HTML.
The recipes website will be the first project done in this course.

Ideally, the project is going to test out the knowledge on different use of tags and attributes.
For now, we are using just HTML, and we have the focus of getting the data to the page as a recipe guide for users.

In the end of the project, I will be writing here what was this experience for me.
