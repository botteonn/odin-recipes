# odin-recipes

This project is done using The Odin Project as the main resource.

### Recipes Website
This will be a simple web page, created for testing the learning path of HTML.
The recipes website will be the first project done in this course.

Ideally, the project is going to test out the knowledge on different use of tags and attributes.
For now, we are using just HTML, and we have the focus of getting the data to the page as a recipe guide for users.

In the end of the project, I will be writing here what was this experience for me.



#### Project end
Was a simple project to recognize all info I gathered on my way on the course.
It was great to see how I remembered well all diferrent tags and attributes to use - as the same for all the git and bash commands.

This is a new step on my learning and knowledge!
Constructing a future career for now on.
